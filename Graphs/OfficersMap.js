// Create a function that returns the shortest path that a police officer has to take in order to arrive to the designated location in a map.
// The input value that the function will take is an string version of the following map:

// map = [
//     O, _, _,
//     _, X, _, T,
//     _, _, _,
// ];

// Each "_" is the path that the officer "O" can take and every "X" is a closed road/obstacle where the officer cannot pass

// Actual input that the function will take:
// map="O__;_X_T;___;"
